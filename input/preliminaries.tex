\begin{definition}[Uniform reliable broadcast]

\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Validity:] If a correct process broadcasts $m$, then it eventually delivers $m$.
\item [Uniform Agreement:] If a process -- correct or not -- delivers $m$, then
  all correct processes eventually deliver $m$.
\item [Uniform Integrity:] $m$ is delivered by a process at most once, and only
  if it was previously broadcast.
\end{asparadesc}

\begin{definition}[Causal delivery]
  
\end{definition}

Figure~\ref{fig:generalproblem} depicts an example where causal order is
violated. Process $p_1$ broadcasts and delivers $m$. Process $p_2$ receives and
delivers $m$. Then, it broadcasts and delivers $m'$. Process $p_3$ receives $m'$
before $m$. Without any causal order enforcement, $p_3$ delivers $m'$ before $m$
violating the condition stating that the delivery of $m$ should precede the
delivery $m'$.

Multiple approaches exist to enforce causal order by either piggybacking control
information in each message, or constraining the network topology. In this
paper, we introduce a causal broadcast protocol freed from both these
requirements.
