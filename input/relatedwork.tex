\TODO{Table comparing the improvement. Local overhead. Number of
  messages. Message overhead.}

\paragraph{Vector clock-based approaches.}
\paragraph{Topological contraint-based approaches.}

\paragraph{Inter-group
  broadcast~\cite{johnson1998scalable,johnson1999intergroup}.} Explain the link
between this approach and our approach (every peer is an inter-group router).


\paragraph{Already received.} Discussion about complexity and application
dependant (Despite the fact that definition of uniform reliable broadcast wants
exactly once delivery).
