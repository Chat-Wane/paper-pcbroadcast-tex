This section reviews the related work of logical clocks. It goes from
piggybacking approaches to vector approaches and their following compaction
approaches. Then, it reviews semantic dependency tracking.

\PAR{Piggybacking approaches~\cite{birman1987reliable,hadzilacos1993fault}.}{A
  trivial way to ensure causal ordering of messages is to piggyback all causally
  related messages since the last broadcast message along with the new broadcast
  message. Even by piggybacking the identifiers of messages instead of messages
  themselves, the broadcast message size may increase quickly depending on the
  application. \CBROADCAST does not piggyback all preceding messages in
  broadcast messages. However, an accumulation of messages arises during
  buffering. As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:complexity}, we can assume that
  links quickly become safe so the buffer size stays small, and we can easily
  set a threshold on the buffer size (see Algorithm~\ref{algo:boundingbuffer}).}

\PAR{Vector clock approaches~\cite{fidge1988timestamps,mattern1989virtual}.}{A
  vector clock is a vector of monotonically increasing counters.  It encodes the
  partial order of messages using this vector:
  $VC(m) < VC(m') \implies m \rightarrow m'$.  Before delivering a message,
  processes using vector-based broadcast check if the vector of the message is
  ready regarding their local vector. If it detects any missing preceding
  message, the process delays the delivery.   To implement this
  vector-based broadcast
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item each process must maintain a vector locally;
  \item each message must piggyback such vector;
  \item there is 1 counter for each process of the network.
  \end{inparaenum}
  To accurately track causality, processes cannot share their entry. To safely
  track causality, processes cannot reclaim entries. Hence, even with
  \textbf{compaction approaches}~\cite{singhal1992efficient}, the vectors grow
  linearly in terms of number of processes that ever broadcast a message.
  Paper~\cite{almeida2008interval} reduces this complexity to depend on the
  actual number of processes in the network.  Still, these approaches do not
  scale, particularly in dynamic networks subject to churn and
  failures. \textbf{Probabilistic approaches~\cite{mostefaoui2017probabilistic}}
  sacrifices on causality tracking accuracy: messages may be delivered out of
  order under a computable boundary. The size of control information in messages
  depends on the desired boundary. \\
  In comparison to these vector-based approaches, our broadcast cannot compare
  any pair of messages; our broadcast cannot state if two messages are
  concurrent or if one precedes the other. Nevertheless, accurate causal
  delivery is a feature provided by default by the propagation scheme. It
  alleviates messages from the need to piggyback heavy control
  information~\cite{friedman2004causal}. Overall, our approach reduces the
  generated traffic of causal broadcast by a factor of $N$ in the most common
  context where processes have partial knowledge of the network membership.}


\noindent Tracking \textbf{semantic dependencies} allows broadcast protocols to
reduce the size of piggybacked control information (\REF). For instance, when
Alice comments Bob's picture, everyone must receive the picture before the
comment. The broadcast message only conveys one semantic dependency. When Alice
comments multiple pictures at once, the broadcast message conveys all
dependencies.  Message overhead increases linearly with the number of semantic
dependencies. To track semantic dependencies, causal broadcast becomes
application dependent. Instead our approach remains
application-agnostic. Comments, pictures, etc. are events that relate to all
preceding events. When Alice comments Bob's picture, everyone will receive this
event before the former event and all other preceding events. Whatever the
number of preceding events, broadcast messages only convey constant size control
information.

% \PAR{Topological approaches.}{A trivial way to ensure causal delivery of
% messages without message overhead consists in building an overlay network shaped
% as a ring: each broadcast message loops once in FIFO order (\REF).
% Unfortunately, maintaining a specific topology can prove costly in dynamic
% networks subject to churn. Our approach relies on a peer-sampling protocol
% \TODO{(Relies on R-broadcast that relies on such psp)} but we make no assumption
% on the built topology. One can choose the most suitable topology depending on
% network settings. For instance, random peer-sampling
% protocols~\cite{jelasity2007gossip} have a low upkeep and guarantee a connected
% network even in dynamic settings.}

% \TODO{Inter-group broadcast is a kind of topological approach.}

% \PAR{Inter-group
%   broadcast~\cite{johnson1998scalable,johnson1999intergroup}.}{Inter-group
% broadcast allows processes to broadcast messages to members of several
% inter-connected networks. Paper~\cite{johnson1999intergroup} states that
% inter-group causal broadcast is ensured when groups that internally ensure
% causal broadcast are linked together by communication channels that ensure FIFO
% ordering of messages. One can employ these approaches to cluster the network in
% subsystems. Control information in messages depends of the size of each small
% subsystem. Our approach is an extreme case where each process is a
% subsystem.}

%% The union of paths taken by broadcast messages builds a diffusion tree, i.e.,
%% a directed acyclic graph, that may change at each broadcast.

% \paragraph{Push-pull~\cite{mercier2017optimal}.} In random graphs, pull is
% optimally fast. Push phase of push-pull improves the startup phase of message
% dissemination. We only present push but it easily can be push-pull. \TODO{Maybe
%   too linked to random graphs.}
