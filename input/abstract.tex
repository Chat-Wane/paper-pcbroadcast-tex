  Many distributed protocols and applications rely on causal broadcast to ensure
  consistency criteria.
  %% However, tracking causality while scaling remains an open
  %% problem. 
  However, none of causality tracking state-of-the-art approaches scale in large
  and dynamic networks.   
  %% State-of-the-art approaches do not scale in large and
  %% dynamic networks.
  % State-of-the-art approaches overload messages with control information the
  % size of which increases linearly compared to either the number of processes,
  % or the number of broadcast messages.
  % These approaches are impracticable in large scale systems subject to churn.
  We present a uniform reliable causal broadcast protocol that outperforms
  state-of-the-art in size of messages, execution time complexity, and local
  space complexity. Most importantly, it does not overload messages with any
  control information.  We prove that this holds in both static and dynamic
  networks.  Consequently, large and dynamic systems can finally afford causal
  broadcast.
