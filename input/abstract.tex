  Many distributed protocols and applications rely on causal broadcast to ensure
  consistency.
  %% However, tracking causality while scaling remains an open
  %% problem. 
  However, none of causality tracking state-of-the-art approaches scale in large
  and dynamic networks.   
  %% State-of-the-art approaches do not scale in large and
  %% dynamic networks.
  % State-of-the-art approaches overload messages with control information the
  % size of which increases linearly compared to either the number of processes,
  % or the number of broadcast messages.
  % These approaches are impracticable in large scale systems subject to churn.
  We present a uniform reliable causal broadcast protocol that does not overload
  messages at all while keeping very small local space requirements. We prove
  that it works in both static and dynamic networks.  Now, large and dynamic
  systems can finally afford causal broadcast.
