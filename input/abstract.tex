  % Designing applications over a message-passing system goes through the
  % definition and the implementation of appropriate communication primitives such
  % as reliable broadcast , causal broadcast and atomic broadcast. 
  
  % This paper presents a new uniform reliable causal broadcast protocol.
  
  % This is not one more protocol as the searching for an effective protocol is
  % still an open problem especially in large and dynamic networks.
  
  % The proposed protocol outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in size of
  % messages, execution time complexity, and local space complexity. Most
  % importantly, the control information piggybacked on messages is of constant
  % size. We prove that for both static and dynamic networks. Consequently, large
  % and dynamic systems can finally afford causal broadcast.

  Many distributed protocols and applications rely on causal broadcast to ensure
  consistency criteria.
  However, none of causality tracking state-of-the-art approaches scale in large
  and dynamic systems.
  This paper presents a new causal broadcast protocol.  The proposed protocol
  outperforms state-of-the-art in size of messages, execution time complexity,
  and local space complexity. Most importantly, messages piggyback control
  information the size of which is constant.  We prove that for both static and
  dynamic systems.  Consequently, large and dynamic systems can finally afford
  causal broadcast.
