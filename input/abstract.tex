  Many distributed protocols and applications rely on causal broadcast to ensure
  consistency criteria.  However, none of causality tracking state-of-the-art
  approaches scale in large and dynamic systems.  This paper presents a new
  non-blocking causal broadcast protocol suited for such systems.  The proposed
  protocol outperforms state-of-the-art in size of messages, execution time
  complexity, and local space complexity. Most importantly, messages piggyback
  control information the size of which is constant.  We prove that for both
  static and dynamic systems.  Consequently, large and dynamic systems can
  finally afford causal broadcast.
