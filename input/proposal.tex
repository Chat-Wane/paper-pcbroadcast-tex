\section{Causal broadcast}
\label{sec:proposal}

We propose an approach guaranteeing causal order to uniform reliable
broadcasts. It only makes use of FIFO communication channels (e.g. TCP), and
relies on scalable peer-sampling protocols that must not create network partitions
(e.g. \SPRAY~\cite{nedelec2017adaptive}, or \CYCLON~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon}).

\paragraph{Static networks.} A network is a set of processes linked by a set of
channels. In a static network, processes cannot fail nor leave, and links cannot
be created nor removed. In this context, FIFO channels are sufficient to provide
causal ordering of messages.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \input{./input/figstatic.tex}
    \caption{\label{fig:static}FIFO channels are sufficient to provide causal
      order in static networks.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:static} shows a static network comprising 3 processes $p_1$,
$p_2$, and $p_3$ linked to each other. The figure does not show messages sent by
$p_3$ for the sake of clarity. In this example, we solve the causal order
violation from Figure~\ref{fig:generalproblem} by using FIFO channels. The
processes receive $m$ and $m'$ multiple times but there exist no link in the
paths from $p_2$ to $p_3$ that carries $m'$ without having carried $m$
beforehand. Hence, the delivery of $m$ always precedes the delivery of $m'$ at
any process.

\paragraph{Dynamic networks.} Removing a channel does not impair causal ordering
of messages except if it generates network partitions.  Adding a channel may
result in causal ordering violation.


\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \input{./input/figproblem.tex}
    \caption{\label{fig:problem}Adding a FIFO channel endangers causal
      ordering.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:problem} illustrates the issue with the establishment of new
FIFO channels. In this example, a FIFO channel links $p_1$ to $p_2$; another
links $p_2$ to $p_3$; none links $p_1$ to $p_3$. Other FIFO channels may exist
but we do not show them for the sake of simplicity. Process $p_1$ broadcasts $m$
and delivers it. $p_3$ receives it by the intermediary of $p_2$. In the
meantime, $p_1$ creates a FIFO channel to $p_3$, then broadcasts $m'$ to $p_2$
and $p_3$. Since the path through $p_2$ is longer in terms of propagation time
compared to the direct connections from $p_1$ to $p_3$, Process $p_3$ receives
and delivers $m'$ before $m$. It violates causal order, for $m$ precedes $m'$.


Solving this issue requires three steps. When a process $p$ wants to use a link to
a process $q$ for causal broadcast,
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item it must use the FIFO channels already in use to transmit a message to $q$
  awaiting for its acknowledgment.
\item While awaiting for this acknowledgement, $p$ buffers each message it
  sends.
\item When $p$ receives the acknowledgment from $q$, it uses the FIFO channel
  from $p$ to $q$ to send its buffered messages. Afterwards, the channel is
  ready to be used for causal broadcast.
\end{enumerate}
