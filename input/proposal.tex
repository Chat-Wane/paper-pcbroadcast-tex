\label{sec:proposal}

We propose an approach guaranteeing causal order to uniform reliable
broadcasts. It only makes use of FIFO communication channels (e.g. TCP), and
relies on scalable peer-sampling protocols that must not create network partitions
(e.g. \SPRAY~\cite{nedelec2017adaptive}, or \CYCLON~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon}).

\paragraph{Static networks.} FIFO channels are sufficient to provide causal
ordering of messages.


\paragraph{Dynamic networks.} Removing a channel do not impair causal ordering
of messages except if it generates network partitions. On the contrary, adding a
channel may result in causal ordering violation. The intuition is that it may
creates paths that are shortcuts for new messages. These messages arrives at
their destination before older messages that causally precedes them, for they
took longer paths.
