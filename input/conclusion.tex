\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we described a uniform reliable causal broadcast that removes the
need for messages to carry any control information. To handle dynamic networks,
our approach only requires the help of buffers the size of which can be bounded
easily. \TODO{Meow meow meow.}

% This makes our causal broadcast suitable for large scale networks subject to
% churn.

% Applications and protocols such as distributed data stores, distributed
% collaborative editors that need to track causal relationships between operations
% can now rely on our causal broadcast.

As future work, we plan to investigate on the problem of duplicated message
detection. Although it only impacts local space complexity, this is the last and
only remaining linear complexity.

% A possible way of improvement lies in the fact that, in static network, each
% process knows how many duplicates of each message it will receive. We could use
% this information to prune the structure of already received
% messages. Unfortunately, it does not hold in dynamic networks.


%% It is awesome.
