Broadcast is a communication primitive allowing a process to send a message to
all other processes in the network. We can add order on message delivery. It
alleviates the burden of applications to check message relationships. FIFO
broadcast exists but not so useful. Causal broadcast is very useful; many
applications require causal order. Holy grail is total order broadcast but not
scalable, equivalent to consensus.
